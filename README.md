# ProAssist → SmartVerses

**This project has been renamed and moved.**

## New home

**[SmartVerses](https://github.com/crownemmanuel/SmartVerses)** — all development and new releases happen there.

## Why this repo exists

This repository only hosts the **final ProAssist release** so that older installed versions can download the update. Once users update from here, the new binary points to the SmartVerses repo for all future updates.

- **Using an older ProAssist?** Check for updates in the app — you’ll get the latest release from here, then the app will use SmartVerses for future updates.
- **New installs or current users:** Use [SmartVerses](https://github.com/crownemmanuel/SmartVerses) for downloads and source code.
