# ProAssist Development Rules

## Release Process

**CRITICAL: NEVER CREATE RELEASES MANUALLY**

- **NEVER** use `gh release create` or create releases through GitHub UI
- **ONLY** create tags using `git tag` and push them
- The CI/CD workflow will automatically create the release when a tag is pushed
- If you accidentally create a release manually, delete it and recreate only the tag

**BEFORE creating any release tag, you MUST:**

1. **Update CHANGELOG.md** - Always document what changed in this release

   - Add a new section at the top with version number and date
   - Include Added/Changed/Fixed sections as appropriate
   - Commit the changelog update before tagging

2. **Run local build** - Always verify the build passes locally

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   - Fix any TypeScript/build errors before creating a tag
   - Never push a tag if the build fails locally

3. **Update version numbers** in:

   - `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`
   - `package.json`
   - `src/components/VersionSettings.tsx` (APP_VERSION constant)

4. **Commit all changes** before creating the tag

5. **Create and push tag** only after:
   - ✅ CHANGELOG.md is updated
   - ✅ Local build passes (`npm run build`)
   - ✅ All version numbers are updated
   - ✅ All changes are committed

## Release Workflow

```bash
# 1. Update version numbers
git add src-tauri/tauri.conf.json package.json src/components/VersionSettings.tsx
git commit -m "Bump version to X.Y.Z"
git push origin main

# 2. Update CHANGELOG.md (REQUIRED)
# Edit CHANGELOG.md, then:
git add CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "Update CHANGELOG for vX.Y.Z"
git push origin main

# 3. Run build locally (REQUIRED)
npm run build

# 4. If build passes, create and push tag (CI/CD will create the release automatically)
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release version X.Y.Z - Description"
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

**IMPORTANT**: After pushing the tag, the GitHub Actions workflow will automatically create the release. Do NOT create the release manually.

## If Build Fails After Tagging

If you already pushed a tag with build errors:

1. Delete tag locally: `git tag -d vX.Y.Z`
2. Delete tag remotely: `git push origin --delete vX.Y.Z`
3. Fix build errors and commit
4. Recreate tag: `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release message"`
5. Push tag again: `git push origin vX.Y.Z`

## Important Reminders

- **NEVER create releases manually** - Only create tags, let CI/CD handle releases
- **Never skip the changelog** - Users need to know what changed
- **Never skip the local build** - CI will fail if build has errors
- **Always update all version files** - Keep them in sync
- **Test before release** - Verify the build works locally first

## If You Accidentally Created a Release Manually

If a release was created manually (via `gh release create` or GitHub UI):

1. Delete the release: `gh release delete vX.Y.Z --yes`
2. Delete the remote tag: `git push origin --delete vX.Y.Z`
3. Create a new tag: `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release version X.Y.Z - Description"`
4. Push the tag: `git push origin vX.Y.Z`
5. Let CI/CD create the release automatically
